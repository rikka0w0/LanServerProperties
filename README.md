# LAN Server Properties
For Minecraft 1.12.2â€“1.20.4, Forge and Fabric.

This branch is for 1.20.2 to 1.20.4,
hopefully it will work in future versions (although very unlikely).

When this mod is installed, it enhances the vanilla Minecraft "Open to LAN" screen, which now also:
* Allows for a port customization.
* Allows a user to disable PvP.
* Allows a user to disable the online mode, so that also unauthenticated players can join the LAN server.
* Allows editing server configuration from the same "Open to LAN" button after the server is published.
* Allows changing maximum number of players.
* Optionally allows the use of genuine UUID (From Microsoft/Mojang) in offline mode, this prevents the loss of inventory contents when switching from online mode to offline mode.

## Note
* This mod is client-only, installing on a dedicated server does nothing.
* Only the Lan server owner need to install this mod.
* Vanilla clients can join your server even if you install this mod, note that other mods you have may prevent vanilla clients from joining.
* Installing this mod does not prevent you from joining other vanilla or mod servers.

## Dependencies
### Forge Version
You need to install Forge and then install this mod.

### Fabric Version
You need to install Fabric Loader and then install this mod. Fabric API is optional but highly recommended.

## For developers
To modify and debug the code, first import the "forge" or "fabric" folder as a Gradle project in Eclipse IDE, and then run the gradle task `genEclipseRuns`.

Windows users need to replace `./` and `../` with `.\` and `..\`, respectively.

Since 1.17.1, LSP for Fabric and Forge share common code as much as possible. The shared code base uses Minecraft official mapping.

### Compile Fabric artifact
```
git clone https://github.com/rikka0w0/LanServerProperties.git
cd LanServerProperties/fabric
./gradlew build
```

To debug in Fabric, one may need to create `run/config/fabric_loader_dependencies.json` with the following content:
```
{
  "version": 1,
  "overrides": {
    "lanserverproperties": {
      "-depends": {
        "minecraft": "IGNORED",
        "fabricloader": "IGNORED"
      }
    }
  }
} 
```

### Compile Forge artifact
```
git clone https://github.com/rikka0w0/LanServerProperties.git
cd LanServerProperties/forge
./gradlew build
```

### To specify JRE path (Since 1.18.1, Minecraft requires Java 17):
```
./gradlew -Dorg.gradle.java.home=/path_to_jdk_directory <commands>
```
